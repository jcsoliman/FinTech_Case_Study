## Overview and Origin

Celsius Network was born on a piece of napkin on the premise that banking is broken. In the summer of 2017, Alex Mashinsky and S. Daniel Leon came up with a model that could disrupt traditional banking by providing financial services that act in the interest of the people. The company's mission is to "harness blockchain technology to provide unprecedented financial freedom, economic opportunity, and income equality for the 99%."

In June 2018, the Celsius app version 1.0.0 was launched enabling crypto users to create a wallet for their ETH and BTC coins. The wallet earns interest on coin deposits and allows users to borrow cash using the coins as collateral.

- **Peer-to-peer lending started in February 2005 with the launch of a UK company, Zopa. A year after, the US launched its first P2P lending Prosper, the first US P2P lending start-up, followed by Lending Club. In 2008, This changed in 2008 after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intervened, citing the need for compliance with the Securities Act of 1933.**

**This led to major changes in the P2P space. Lenders were required to register with the commission, which kicked LendingClub out of action for six months before it could be reactivated. Others left the market altogether. Zopa’s CEO cited registering with the commission as the “key reason why we didn’t launch … in the US.”**

**The market is expected to grow from 2016 to 2024 at 48.2% CAGR - worth USD 897.85bn by the end of 2024. This tremendous growth has compelled big players in traditional banking to respond with investments such as Marcus by Goldman Sachs.**
