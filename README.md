## Overview and Origin

Celsius Network was born on a piece of napkin on the premise that banking is broken. In the summer of 2017, Alex Mashinsky and S. Daniel Leon came up with a model that could disrupt traditional banking by providing financial services that act in the interest of the people. The company's mission is to "harness blockchain technology to provide unprecedented financial freedom, economic opportunity, and income equality for the 99%."

In June 2018, the Celsius app version 1.0.0 was launched enabling the crypto community to create a wallet for their ETH and BTC coins. The wallet earns interest on coin deposits and allows users to borrow cash using the coins as collateral.

Since its launch, the company has continously broken records. As of the latest press release, Celsius now manages more than USD 300mm in deposits and has issued more than USD 2bn of loans.


| AUM | Loan origination | Loan trades completed | Interest payments | Members | Countries |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| USD 300mm | USD 2bn | 160,000 | USD 3mm | 40,000 | 160 |

Currently operating in version 3.1.0, the app allows 19 coins with 7 more underway.

## Business Activities

The company believes the traditional banking system is broken arguing that intermediaries have an unfair power over the people. Just by mere introducing the borrowers to the lenders, the current system earns a huge margin by giving back as little as 1% on deposits and charging as high as 25% interest on loans. With a hashtag #unbankyourself and a team led by a serial social entrepreneur who introduced the world to VoIP, Celsius aims to address this problem by providing a platform to earn and borrow on the blockchain. Leveraging on the technology and their asset-crypto-collateral management model, they are able to charge lower interest on loans and higher interest on deposits.

Loans are issued against the users' crypto deposits used as collateral instead of using the traditional credit score, a key obstacle for the underbanked and credit pooor to access financial services. Deposits are in the custody of partner, BitGo. To protect form borrower default, the member's digital assets are backed by the Lenders' Insurance Pool which is funded through ICO and Celsius Network fees.

The company is funded by the cryptocurrency token, CEL, which the company also uses to incentivize ownership. By owning CEL, members have access to better interest rates on both their deposits and loans. In addition, Celsius offers CelPay, a service that allows users to send and receive crypto without charging any fees.

By providing an innovative and easily accessible personal finance platform, the company is enabling the shift from using crypto as money-earning asset to using it as a form of exchange. Celsius believes that an increased adoption of the cryptopcurrency shifts the power from the traditional banks back to the people, democratizing interest income and sharing as much as 80% of revenue to their customers.

To expand coverage and userbase, the company allows integration of corporate partners with the Celsius network. Using Celsius API, partners are able to use or delegate access to the company's proprietary network, with features that include KYC checking, deposits and withdrawals, and balance checking.

## Landscape:

One of Forbes' 10 FinTech start-ups tyo watch for in 2018, Celsius covers multiple FinTech domains including personal finance, lending, blockchain, cryptocurrency, open banking and payments. Although arguably, the company's primary business model aims to disrupt the peer-to-peer lending.

Peer-to-peer lending started in February 2005 with the launch of a UK company, Zopa. A year after, the US launched its first P2P lending Prosper, the first US P2P lending start-up, followed by Lending Club. In 2008, This changed in 2008 after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intervened, citing the need for compliance with the Securities Act of 1933.**

**This led to major changes in the P2P space. Lenders were required to register with the commission, which kicked LendingClub out of action for six months before it could be reactivated. Others left the market altogether. Zopa’s CEO cited registering with the commission as the “key reason why we didn’t launch … in the US.”**

**The market is expected to grow from 2016 to 2024 at 48.2% CAGR - worth USD 897.85bn by the end of 2024. This tremendous growth has compelled big players in traditional banking to respond with investments such as Marcus by Goldman Sachs.**

**It is not clear whether this market size includes the crypto market. but setting aside crypto adoption rate, it is clear that there is an upside potential for companies like Celsius to take advantage of this growing market.**

**Looking at the crypto ecosystem, Celsius is competing with start-ups offering similar services like SALT, Ethlend and Nexo.**
