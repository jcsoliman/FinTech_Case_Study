## Overview and Origin

Celsius Network was born on a piece of napkin on the premise that banking is broken. In the summer of 2017, Alex Mashinsky and S. Daniel Leon came up with a model that could disrupt traditional banking by providing financial services that act in the interest of the people. The company's mission is to "harness blockchain technology to provide unprecedented financial freedom, economic opportunity, and income equality for the 99%."

On March 23rd, 2018, the company successfully completed its ICO (initial coin offering) raising USD 50mm with CEL tokens sold at USD 0.20 each.
